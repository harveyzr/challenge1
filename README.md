<Challenge of Semantics>

## Description 

This is the first challenge of the Ohio State coding camp. Starter code was provided for this challenge including; index.html, style.css, image files. There is a single page titled “Horiseon” with active links in the header. 
-	My motivation for this project was to become proficient at HTML, and CSS. 
-	Building this project allowed me to implement coding techniques that I have been studying. 
-	This page was a perfect example of real-world practices and solved the problem of starter code not being organized and labeled with proper semantics. 
-	I learned how to take starter code and apply structure and organization.
